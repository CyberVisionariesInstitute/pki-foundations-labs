# Week 01 — PKI Foundations
## Overview

This week establishes the core mechanics of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI):
- Key pair generation
- Digital certificate inspection
- Trust chain validation
- Understanding how systems verify trust

These labs are designed to move from concept → observation → verification.

## Learning Focus
By completing Week 01, you should be able to:
- Explain how a public/private key pair works
- Describe what a digital certificate asserts
- Identify components of a certificate (Issuer, SAN, validity, signature algorithm)
- Explain how a certificate chain is validated
- Describe what a trust anchor is and where it lives

This is foundational knowledge for all PKI, IAM, and cloud security work.

## Lab Structure
Complete the following labs in order:
1. keypair-generation.md
2. certificate-inspection.md
3. trust-chain-validation.md

Each lab must be completed directly in your portfolio repository.

## Submission Expectations
For each lab:
- Write in your own words
- Include screenshots where required
- Explain why something happened — not just what happened
- Use clear, professional commit messages

Screenshots should be stored in:

assets/screenshots/week-01/

## Professional Standard
This repository is not homework storage.

It is your public technical portfolio.

Your explanations should demonstrate:
- Conceptual understanding
- Attention to detail
- Clear written communication
- Professional Git discipline

## Reflection
After completing all labs, update:
reflections/week-01.md

Answer:
-What part of PKI felt most intuitive?
- What part felt most complex?
- Which PKI-related career path currently interests you — and why?

## Why This Matters

PKI is invisible infrastructure.

Understanding how trust is built and validated differentiates you from most early-career professionals.

This week builds your technical foundation.
Future weeks build on it.
