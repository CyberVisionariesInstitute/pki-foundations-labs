# Week 1 Lesson Notes — Digital Trust & Identity

## 1. What is Digital Trust?
Digital trust is the confidence that:
- a system is talking to the right system/person (**identity**),
- the information hasn’t been altered (**integrity**),
- and sensitive data is protected (**confidentiality**).

In real environments, digital trust is established through **cryptography + policy + verification**.

## 2. Identity vs Authentication vs Authorization
- **Identity**: who/what an entity claims to be (user, server, device, service).
- **Authentication**: proving that identity (password, certificate, MFA, key).
- **Authorization**: what that authenticated entity is allowed to do (permissions, access).

PKI is most commonly used for **authentication** and **secure key exchange** at scale.

## 3. Public Keys vs Private Keys
A key pair has two mathematically related keys:

### Private Key
- Must be protected
- Used to **sign** (prove possession) or **decrypt** (in some schemes)
- If compromised, trust is compromised

### Public Key
- Safe to distribute
- Used to **verify signatures** or **encrypt to the holder**

Key idea:
- **Private key = capability**
- **Public key = verification/encryption to you**

---

## 4. What is a Certificate?
A certificate is an identity document for a key.

It binds:
- a public key
- to an identity (subject / DNS name / organization)
- and is vouched for by a trusted authority (issuer / CA)

A certificate answers:
> “Who does this public key belong to, and should I trust that claim?”

## 5. Certificates vs Encryption (Common Confusion)
Certificates are not “encryption.”

Certificates enable secure encryption at scale by:
- making identity verifiable
- enabling trust decisions
- supporting secure key exchange (e.g., TLS)

Encryption is the *mechanism* that protects data.
Certificates are part of the *trust framework* that makes encryption usable in real systems.

## 6. Where PKI Shows Up
You interact with PKI constantly:
- HTTPS websites (TLS certificates)
- Mobile device management (device certs)
- Corporate Wi-Fi (802.1X cert auth)
- Email security (S/MIME)
- Code signing (signed executables)
- APIs and microservices (mTLS)

---

## 7. Mental Model to Keep
PKI is a system for:
**Identity + Trust + Verification at scale**

If you keep that model, the technical pieces later will make sense.
