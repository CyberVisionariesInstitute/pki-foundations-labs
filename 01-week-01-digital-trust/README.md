# Week 1 — Digital Trust & Identity

## Focus
This week establishes the mental model for PKI: **digital trust**, **identity**, and how systems decide what to trust.

You will learn the difference between:
- **Public vs. private keys**
- **Certificates vs. encryption**
- **Identity vs. authentication vs. authorization**

---

## Outcomes
By the end of Week 1, you can:
- Define digital trust in practical terms
- Explain what a public key and private key do (and what they do *not* do)
- Explain what a certificate is and why it exists
- Describe why certificates are not “encryption,” but enable secure encryption at scale
- Identify where PKI shows up in everyday technology (web, email, devices, code)
