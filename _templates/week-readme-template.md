# Week 2 — Cryptography Fundamentals (Just Enough)

## Focus

This week builds operational literacy in the core cryptographic primitives that power PKI systems.

You will move from conceptual understanding to direct application of:

- Symmetric encryption  
- Hashing  
- Digital signatures  

These mechanisms form the foundation of certificates, TLS, and digital trust.

---

## Outcomes

By the end of this week, you can:

- Explain the difference between confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity
- Encrypt and decrypt data using symmetric encryption
- Generate and compare cryptographic hashes
- Digitally sign and verify files
- Identify why private key protection is critical in PKI systems

---

## Deliverables (Submit in Your Portfolio Repo)

Update the following areas of your repository:

- `labs/02-week-02-cryptography-fundamentals/`
- `notes/week-02-key-concepts.md`
- `reflections/week-02.md`

Place generated cryptographic artifacts inside:
labs/02-week-02-cryptography-fundamentals/submissions/


---

## Artifact Rules

- Commit actual generated files (not screenshots).
- Use the `assets/` folder only for documentation images if needed.
- **Do NOT commit private keys.**

Private keys must never be stored in version control.
