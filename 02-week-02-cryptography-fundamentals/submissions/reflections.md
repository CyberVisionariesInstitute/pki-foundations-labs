## Prompts

### 1. What did you learn this week?

Explain in your own words:

- The difference between confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity
- How symmetric encryption works
- How hashing detects tampering
- How digital signatures combine hashing and asymmetric cryptography

Avoid copying definitions. Demonstrate understanding.

---

### 2. What concept was most challenging?

Consider:

- Understanding why hashing cannot be reversed
- Grasping why digital signatures fail after tampering
- Differentiating encryption from signing

Explain what made it challenging and how you worked through it.

---

### 3. Where does this appear in real-world systems?

Provide specific examples such as:

- HTTPS connections
- Code signing
- Software updates
- Certificate Authorities
- Internal enterprise PKI systems

Be concrete. Avoid vague answers.

---

### 4. How would you explain this topic to a non-technical audience?

Explain:

- What encryption does
- What hashing does
- What digital signatures prove

Keep it simple but accurate.

---

### 5. What questions remain?

List any uncertainties about:

- Key management
- Trust chains
- TLS
- Certificate signing
- Enterprise implementation

These questions will inform Week 3.

## Professional Growth Check

- Did you explain concepts in your own words?
- Did you connect theory to practice?
- Did you reference your lab observations?
- Is your formatting clean and structured?
- Was your commit message meaningful?

## Forward Link

Week 2 introduced the mechanisms that enforce digital trust.

Week 3 will show how X.509 certificates combine encryption, hashing, and digital signatures into a structured trust model.

Be prepared to inspect certificates with deeper technical understanding.
