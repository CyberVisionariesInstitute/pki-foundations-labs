# Week 2 — Cryptography Fundamentals Labs

#### Focus: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Authenticity

This week moves from theory to application. You will work directly with the cryptographic primitives that power PKI and secure communications.

By completing these labs, you will demonstrate practical understanding of:

- **Encryption** → Confidentiality  
- **Hashing** → Integrity  
- **Digital Signatures** → Integrity + Authenticity

## Lab Overview

| Lab     | Topic                   | Security Property          |
|---------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| Lab 01  | Symmetric Encryption    | Confidentiality            |
| Lab 02  | Hashing & Integrity     | Integrity                  |
| Lab 03  | Digital Signatures      | Integrity + Authenticity   |

---

## Lab Files

Complete each lab in order:

- Lab 01 — Encrypt a File Symmetrically  
- Lab 02 — Create a Hash of a File  
- Lab 03 — Digitally Sign and Verify a File  

---

## Submission Instructions

### 1. Use the Week 2 submissions folder

Place all generated artifacts inside:
02-week-02-cryptography-fundamentals/submissions/


Create the following structure if it does not already exist:
submissions/
encrypted/
hashes/
signatures/


---

### 2. Commit Required Artifacts

You must commit:

- Encrypted file(s)
- Decrypted output (if applicable)
- Hash output files
- Signature file(s)
- Public key (if applicable)
- Short explanations in this Week 2 README

---

### 3. Artifact Placement Rules

- Use the `submissions/` folder for generated cryptographic artifacts.
- Use the `assets/` folder only for screenshots or documentation images.
- Do not submit screenshots unless explicitly requested.

---

### 4. Security Requirement

**Do NOT commit private keys.**

Private keys should never be stored in version control.

---

## Completion Criteria

You are considered complete when:

- All required artifacts are present  
- Verification commands succeed  
- Signature verification fails after tampering  
- You can clearly explain:
  - What encryption protects  
  - Why a hash changes when data changes  
  - Why a digital signature fails after modification  

---

## Why This Matters

Everything in PKI relies on these primitives:

- Certificates are digitally signed  
- TLS uses symmetric encryption  
- Trust validation depends on hashing  

Week 3 builds directly on this foundation with an X.509 certificate deep dive.

Master these fundamentals before moving forward.
