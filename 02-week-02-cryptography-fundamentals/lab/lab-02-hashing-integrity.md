# Lab — Hashing & Integrity

## Goal

This lab builds operational understanding of cryptographic hashing and the security property of integrity.

You will:

- Generate a SHA-256 hash of a file
- Modify the file
- Generate a new hash
- Observe how even small changes completely alter the hash value

---

## Part 1 — Setup

### Prerequisites

- OpenSSL installed
- Access to a local terminal
- Week 2 portfolio folder created

All commands must be executed locally.

---

## Part 2 — Execution Steps

### Step 1 — Create Artifact Directory

From the root of your repository:

mkdir -p labs/02-week-02-cryptography-fundamentals/submissions/hashes

### Step 2 — Create a Test File
echo "Week 2 Hashing Lab - CVI" > labs/02-week-02-cryptography-fundamentals/submissions/hashes/message.txt

Open the file and confirm it is readable.

### Step 3 — Generate a SHA-256 Hash
openssl dgst -sha256 labs/02-week-02-cryptography-fundamentals/submissions/hashes/message.txt \
> labs/02-week-02-cryptography-fundamentals/submissions/hashes/message.sha256.txt

Open the hash file and observe:
- A fixed-length output
- A hexadecimal string
- The algorithm used (SHA-256)

### Step 4 — Modify (Tamper With) the File
echo "tampered" >> labs/02-week-02-cryptography-fundamentals/submissions/hashes/message.txt

Even a single character change is enough.

### Step 5 — Generate a New Hash
openssl dgst -sha256 labs/02-week-02-cryptography-fundamentals/submissions/hashes/message.txt \
> labs/02-week-02-cryptography-fundamentals/submissions/hashes/message_tampered.sha256.txt

Compare the two hash outputs.

They should be completely different.

## Part 3 — Observations
Document the following in your Week 2 notes:
- Why the hash changed after a small modification
- Why hashing does NOT provide confidentiality
- What security property hashing provides
- Where hashing is used in PKI systems

Examples to consider:
- Certificate signatures
- File integrity validation
- Code signing

### Submission (Portfolio Repo)
Ensure the following files exist:

labs/02-week-02-cryptography-fundamentals/submissions/hashes/
  message.txt
  message.sha256.txt
  message_tampered.sha256.txt

Commit and push your changes.

Do not upload screenshots unless explicitly requested.

## Stretch (Optional)
Try using a different hashing algorithm:

openssl dgst -sha512 message.txt

- How does the output length compare?
- Why are weak hashing algorithms (like SHA-1) no longer recommended?
