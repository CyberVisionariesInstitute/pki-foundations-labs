# 00 – Getting Started

Welcome to the PKI Foundations Labs repository.

This folder explains how to work within the CVI GitHub environment.

---

## 1. What You Need

- A GitHub account
- Access to the CVI repositories
- Basic comfort navigating GitHub (no advanced Git required)

---

## 2. How This Cohort Uses GitHub

GitHub is used as:

- A lab instruction platform
- A documentation workspace
- A professional portfolio builder

Students will:
1. Follow lab instructions from this repository
2. Complete labs locally or conceptually
3. Document results in their personal portfolio repository
4. Commit their work weekly

---

## 3. Student Workflow Overview

Each week:

1. Review the lesson notes
2. Complete the lab exercise
3. Document findings in your portfolio repository
4. Commit changes with a clear message

Example commit message:

Add Week 1 digital trust reflection

---

## 4. Portfolio Repository

Each student will generate a personal portfolio repository from:

cvi-student-portfolio-template

This repository is where all of your work lives.

You will not submit work in the curriculum repository.

Instead:

Labs live in the labs/ folder

Notes live in the notes/ folder

Reflections live in the reflections/ folder

Projects live in the projects/ folder

Screenshots and supporting files live in the assets/ folder

For a complete breakdown of the portfolio structure, refer to:

👉 The README.md file inside your portfolio repository.

That file is your structural guide for where all work should be documented.

## 5. Professional Standards

- Clear documentation
